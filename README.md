# Ramda X

Ramda X is a super small API with only 10 most important methods for functional programming. Original Ramda library is to big and abstracts almost everything away from the JavaScript language. That's why Ramda X just uses the most important concepts from FP and leaves everything as it is. All implemented methods are auto-curried!!!


* Implemented API methods:

- curry()
- compose()
- pipe()
- map()
- filter()

* Methods on the waiting list:

* pluck() // -> returns a new list by plucking the same named poperty -> works on lists
* prop() // to use it with map -> returns a property -> works on objects
* propEq() // to use it with filter() -> returns a boolean
- n/a
- n/a
