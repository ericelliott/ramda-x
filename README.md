# Ramda X

Ramda X is a super small API with only 10 most important methods for functional programming. Original Ramda library is to big and abstracts almost everything away from the JavaScript language. That's why Ramda X just uses the most important concepts from FP and leaves everything as it is. All implemented methods are auto-curried!!!


* Implemented API methods:

* curry()
* compose()
* pipe()
* map()
* filter()

* Methods on the waiting list:

* pluck() 
* prop() // to use it with map
* propEq() // to use it with filter()
* functor
* monads

If you want the full suite, just use
