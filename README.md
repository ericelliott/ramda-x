# Ramda X

Ramda X is a super small API with only 10 most important methods for functional programming. Original Ramda library is to big and abstracts almost everything away from the JavaScript language. That's why Ramda X just uses the most important concepts from FP and leaves everything as it is. All implemented methods are auto-curried!!!


* Implemented API methods:

- **I.** curry()
- **II.** compose()
- **III.** pipe()
- **IV.** map()
- **V.** filter()

* Methods on the waiting list:

- **VI.** pluck() // -> returns a new list by plucking the same named poperty -> works on lists
- **VII.** prop() // to use it with map -> returns a property -> works on objects
- **VIII.** propEq() // to use it with filter() -> returns a boolean
- **IX.** n/a
- **X.** n/a

* Additional methods for debugging Ramda X

**Zero** trace() ```js trace('label')(value)
